# ml_mmpa - Functional Group analysis of Matched Molecular Pairs

## Description
Identifying and quantifying functional group exchange relationships from matched pair analysis

  1. Generate matched molecualr pairs from a set of compounds with activities
  2. Filter transforms for statistical significance
  3. Identify functional groups in the transforms
  4. Derive functional group exchange realtionship w.r.t. activity
